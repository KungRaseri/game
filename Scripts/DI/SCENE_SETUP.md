# Godot Scene Setup Instructions

Since I can't directly create .tscn files, here are the steps to set up the dependency injection demonstration:

## 1. Autoload Setup

1. Open Godot Editor
2. Go to **Project → Project Settings → Autoload**
3. Click the folder icon next to "Path"
4. Navigate to `Scripts/DI/DependencyInjectionNode.cs`
5. Set **Node Name** to: `DependencyInjection`
6. Click **Add**

## 2. Create Demo Scene

1. Create a new scene
2. Add a `Node2D` as the root node
3. Name it `DIDemo`
4. Add a child `Node` to DIDemo
5. Attach script `Scripts/DI/DependencyRegistrationNode.cs` to the child node
6. Name the child node `ServiceRegistration`
7. Add another child `Node2D` to DIDemo
8. Attach script `Scripts/DI/Examples/ExampleGameNode.cs` to this child
9. Name it `ExampleNode`
10. Save the scene as `DIDemo.tscn`

## 3. Test the Integration

1. Run the scene
2. Check the output console for dependency injection messages
3. You should see:
   - ✅ Dependency injection initialized successfully!
   - ✅ Injected services
   - Test integration messages
   - CQS command and query executions

## 4. Scene Structure

```
DIDemo (Node2D)
├── ServiceRegistration (Node) [Scripts/DI/DependencyRegistrationNode.cs]
└── ExampleNode (Node2D) [Scripts/DI/Examples/ExampleGameNode.cs]
```

## 5. Expected Console Output

When you run the scene, you should see output similar to:

```
Initializing custom dependency injection...
Registered X services
✅ Dependency injection initialized successfully!
[TIMESTAMP] DITest: Dependency injection integration test successful!
✅ CQS Integration test - Status: GameStatus { IsRunning = True, CurrentScene = DIDemo, PlayerCount = 1 }
Dependency Registration Node ready - services configured in DependencyInjectionNode
[TIMESTAMP] SceneReady: DependencyRegistrationNode scene is ready
✅ Injected IGameService into ExampleGameNode.GameService
✅ Injected IGameService into ExampleGameNode._gameServiceField
ExampleGameNode ready
✅ Property injection successful!
✅ Field injection successful!
[TIMESTAMP] NodeReady: ExampleGameNode has been initialized
Game Status - Running: True, Scene: DIDemo, Players: 1
```

This demonstrates:
- Successful DI container initialization
- Service registration and injection
- CQS pattern integration (commands and queries working)
- Proper integration between Godot nodes and business logic

## 6. Testing Input

When the scene is running:
- Press **SPACE** to trigger the input event example
- This will log a key press event through the CQS system

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the expected output:
1. Verify DependencyInjectionNode is in autoload
2. Check that both scripts are properly attached to nodes
3. Ensure the scene is saved and run correctly
4. Look for any error messages in the console
