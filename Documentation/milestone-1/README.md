- Data-driven approach for easy expansion
- Factory pattern with convenience methods

#### **CombatSystem**
- Core combat loop with real-time damage calculations

- Event coordination for UI updates

#### **AdventurerController**
- High-level adventurer actions (send to dungeon, retreat)
- Event coordination and status reporting
- Integration point between UI and combat system
- Clean public API for UI consumption

#### **UI Components with Godot Integration**

- `CombatLogUI` - Event logging with rich text and auto-scroll
- `ExpeditionPanelUI` - Progress tracking and dungeon information
- `MainGameScene` - Complete orchestration and system coordination

## 🎮 Complete Game Loop (Verified Working)

**Player Experience Flow:**
1. **Game Initialization** - All systems start properly, UI displays default state
2. **Adventurer Status** - Player sees adventurer health (100/100 HP) and "Idle" state
3. **Send Expedition** - Click "Send to Goblin Cave" button (enabled only when idle)
4. **Real-time Combat** - Watch adventurer fight 3 goblins sequentially
5. **Live Updates** - Health bar changes color, combat log shows events, progress updates
6. **Dynamic States** - Observe state transitions: traveling → fighting → retreating/regenerating
7. **Completion** - Expedition ends with success or retreat based on health threshold
8. **Recovery** - Adventurer regenerates health and returns to "Idle" for next expedition

## 🔧 Usage Example

```csharp
// Initialize the complete game system
var gameManager = new GameManager();
gameManager.Initialize();

// Set up event handlers for logging
gameManager.AdventurerController.StatusUpdated += message => 
	Console.WriteLine($"Status: {message}");

// Send adventurer to dungeon (creates 3 goblins automatically)
gameManager.AdventurerController.SendToGoblinCave();

// Update loop (call regularly, e.g., in Godot's _Process())
gameManager.Update();

// Check adventurer status
var status = gameManager.AdventurerController.GetStatusInfo();
// Returns: "HP: 85/100 (85%) | State: Fighting | Fighting: Goblin (12/20 HP)"

// Create custom entities using the factory
var customAdventurer = EntityFactory.CreateNoviceAdventurer("Bob the Brave");
var trollBoss = EntityFactory.CreateTroll("Ancient Cave Troll");
```
